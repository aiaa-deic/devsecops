# Contributing

This project supports contributions!

The source code for this project automatically builds a public facing website available at <https://devsecops.aiaadeic.org>.
There is a page on that website you can review to learn more about how to contribute to our project.
That page is [available here](https://devsecops.aiaadeic.org/about/contributing.html) as a web page,
or you can review the [markdown source code](https://github.com/aiaa-deic/devsecops/tree/main/docs/about/contributing.md) of that page directly in GitHub.
