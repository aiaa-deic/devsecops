# Contributing

We welcome contributions in many different forms.
Select the form of contribution to the right that most closely matches your interest.

## Joining the Subcommittee

If you would like to get involved with the Subcommittee, contact [Josh Haines](mailto:Josh@JoshHaines.com).
Other good first steps would be joining the [AIAA](https://aiaa.org) as a member.
You can find more information about membership [here](https://www.aiaa.org/membership).

## Contributing to this Website

This website is built and deployed automatically using GitHub Actions
and is created based on the source code found in the repository located <https://github.com/aiaa-deic/devsecops>.
Updating the source code for this site will be very similar to contributing to other open source projects.
GitHub has a [fantastic article](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects)
using the forking method to contribute to a project.
That path is appropriate for external users hoping to make contributions.

For other subcommittee members, you may be able to push changes directly to the main repository.
The best way to get help with contributions is
to raise an [issue](https://github.com/aiaa-deic/devsecops/issues) in the repository
where someone can answer your questions and provide guidance.

### Formatting on this Website

This website is built using [VitePress,](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/) which is a Vue.js based static site generator.
To add content, you'll need to write markdown files and then add them to the appropriate location in the repository.
If you aren't familiar with Markdown, _markdownguide.org_ has a [useful guide available](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
There is also a [VitePress specific guide available](https://vitepress.dev/guide/markdown) which lists specific features above and beyond what is available with standard markdown.

As above, if you have any problems
